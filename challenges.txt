1 Implement a restriction that users can only review a tour 
that they have actually booked

2 Implement nested booking routes /tours/:id/bookings and /users/:id/bookings

3 Improve tour dates: add participants and soldOut fields to each date
A data then becomes like an instance of the tour. Then when a user books, they need to select one of the dates.
A new booking will increase the number of participants
until it is booked out (participants > maxGroupSize)
So when user wants to book, you need to check if tour on the selected date
is still available

4 Implement advanced authentications feautures: confirm user email etc

5 Implement sign up form, similar to the login form!

6 On the tour detail page, if a user has taken a tour
allow them add a review directly on the website. Implement a form

7 Hide the entire booking section on the tour detail page if
current user has already booked the tour (also prevent duplicate bookings on the model)

8 Implement "like tour" functionality with favourite tour page

9 On the user account page implement the My Reviews page, where all reviews are displayed
and a user can edit them (React?)

10 For admin, implement all "Manage" pages
